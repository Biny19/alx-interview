This function first checks if n is less than or equal to 0, in which case it returns an empty list. 
Otherwise, it initializes the triangle list with the first row, which is always [1]. 
Then, it iteratively calculates each row of Pascal's triangle and appends it to the triangle list 
until it reaches the desired number of rows n. 
Finally, it returns the complete Pascal's triangle as a list of lists.i
